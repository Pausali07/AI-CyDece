# AI-CyDece — Project Scope, Problem Statement & Objectives

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Cyber attackers constantly evolve their tactics, leaving traditional intrusion detection and static honeypots insufficient. Modern honeypots capture data but fail to dynamically engage attackers or interpret the context of their behavior. This leads to delayed analysis, limited attacker interaction, and weak intelligence extraction.

## 🎯 Project Scope
AI-CyDece aims to integrate **Artificial Intelligence (Large Language Models)** with **Cyber Deception Technologies (Honeypots)** to:
- Create adaptive honeypots that **simulate realistic responses**.
- Log attacker activity and **interpret behaviors intelligently**.
- Automatically generate **human-readable threat reports**.
- Provide a **dashboard interface** for quick analysis and visualization.

## 🧭 Objectives
1. **Design and deploy honeypots** (Zeek / Cowrie) that attract attackers in a controlled environment.
2. **Capture and parse logs** from network traffic and command interactions.
3. **Use LLMs (e.g., GPT-based models)** to summarize and interpret attack patterns.
4. **Automate the generation** of technical and executive-level threat reports.
5. **Develop a lightweight dashboard** for visualizing attack timelines and summaries.
6. Ensure **containerization and scalability** via Docker.

## 🧪 Expected Outcome
A fully functional prototype of an **AI-powered cyber deception framework** that:
- Logs and analyzes attacker interactions.
- Generates AI-written reports automatically.
- Can be extended for SOC (Security Operations Center) automation use cases.
